It’s October already which means that
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is here again! And
Kowainik has prepared a list of the beginner-friendly (and not only) issues to
work on so you can get your feet wet in contributing to the open-source Haskell
projects. Don't miss the opportunity to learn Haskell in a fun and exciting way,
help the ecosystem and win the prizes for yourself! Check out the whole pack of the
issues that are ready for grabs:

* [Hacktoberfest issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AHacktoberfest+org%3Akowainik+is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+)

## Why might you be interested?

You might ask why to participate in this event and why to sweat on the issues in
our organisation? Here are several reasons for you to do so:

1. In Kowainik we offer the Haskell mentorship to all people willing to learn
   Haskell. So you can explore some Haskell by working on the real-life projects
   that we’re using in production.
2. We can help you to become a more active user of the open-source community by
   guiding through the git workflows and supporting in applying the best
   contributing practices.
3. You can [win a pretty cool T-shirt](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details)
   from the Hacktoberfest organizers.

## What you can work on

Below you can find the list of our projects where we offer interesting tasks for
every taste or we have issues where we need your help (marked with the
`Hacktoberfest` label):

1. [summoner](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner): The CLI tool that helps to
   create the completely configured production-ready projects. If you want to
   create a Haskell project with the properly specified package-metadata,
   configured Travis CI, cool badges in README and much more, then you can
   entrust `summoner` with doing this job for you.

2. [containers-backpack](https://github.com/kowainik/containers-backpack):
   Backpack implementation of the interfaces for `containers`. If you want to
   learn Backpack or get more experience in designing interfaces then you might
   be interested in solving the issues for this project. To help you start with
   this we have the Backpack tutorial and the blog post about
   `containers-backpack`
   [here](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2018-08-19-picnic-put-containers-into-a-backpack).

3. [co-log](https://github.com/kowainik/co-log): The composable and
   contravariant logging library. We’ve just released the library (see the
   recent announcement
   [here](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2018-09-25-co-log)), but there is no
   time to rest, we still have a lot of improvements on the mind. You might be
   interested in this project if you want to learn the `Contravariant`
   typeclasses or want to participate in
   improving the logging framework architecture.

4. [typerep-map](https://github.com/kowainik/typerep-map): An extremely fast
   dependent map. Do you want to use the brand new
   [`-XQuantifiedConstraints`](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/QuantifiedConstraints)?
   Or figure out how to use fast mutable arrays in Haskell? Or challenge
   yourself in writing some benchmarks? In that case the issues in the
   `typerep-map` library might be attractive to you! Don’t worry, if the project
   looks complicated at first, there’s
   [the blog post](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2018-07-11-typerep-map-step-by-step)
   where we described the details of the implementation.

5. [relude](https://github.com/kowainik/relude): An alternative prelude. If you
   ever wanted to participate in inventing or improving the standard library
   then this is your chance!

   > [`relude` Hacktoberfest issues](https://github.com/kowainik/relude/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest)
6. [smuggler](https://github.com/kowainik/smuggler): Haskell Source Plugin that
   removes unused imports. Have you ever wanted to implement some programming
   language tooling that makes the life of every programmer easier? With
   `smuggler` you can have a feel of working with GHC as a library.

7. [tomland](https://github.com/kowainik/tomland): the bidirectional
   [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#readme) parser. This library offers
   an opportunity to work on the issues that can help you to learn parser
   combinators or property-based testing with the
   [hedgehog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog) library. But you
   also can operate on improving the library’s interface as well.

If we convinced you to take part in this month-long celebration of open source
development, feel free to drop a comment under the appealing issue. If you’re
not sure, you can also mail us at xrom.xkov@gmail.com and ask any questions.

Good luck and Happy Hacktoberfest!
