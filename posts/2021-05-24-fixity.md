Overwhelmed by the huge number of custom operators in Haskell? Work
with a popular library, but it looks overly intimidating due to the
abundance of intricate-looking operators? For many Haskell engineers,
these problems are real. Developers can experience massive anxiety,
based solely on the fact that they need to deal with such API that
throws a bunch of custom operators in their faces (we call such
interfaces *"inthefaces"*).

To get a deeper understanding of the problem and develop firefighting
techniques, let's have a closer look at operators and how to work with
them.

This post is useful for both newcomers and language adepts, seeking
ground rules around using operators and must-do things when
introducing your own operators.

## Difficulty

Let's first discuss why custom operators often feel so
unfriendly. Since Haskell allows defining custom operators, you can
find many creative symbolic names used for diverse purposes in various
codebases. Unfortunately, they can decrease readability and
maintainability and increase the entrance threshold for new joiners.

When you see an unfamiliar operator (e.g. `%~|`), usually it's not
clear what it should do solely from its name. If you are familiar with
some [guidance of operator naming](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/naming-conventions#operator-conventions)
in a particular context, you could figure out the meaning by analysing
each symbol. But in general, there are no rules; you're on your own.

The arbitrary-looking name doesn't provide any hint to guide you
through code understanding when you see it for the first
time. Moreover, even if you manage to get the logic of custom
operators, this information vanishes out of your brain the second
after you finish using it. In other words, such knowledge is not
long-term unless you use it all the time (e.g. `+`, `/=`, etc.).

Unfortunately, another difficulty point of operators is that they
bring an additional layer of complexity — *implicit parentheses*. The
compiler has special rules for parsing expressions with operators
(unlike ordinary functions), determined by each operator
independently. The compilation result, driven by individual rules for
every operator, sets your code's correctness and even performance: you
may see unexpected compiler errors (inability to parse expression) or
even wrong runtime results when mixing different operators.

However, despite all challenges associated with using operators,
careful usage can lead to elegant and idiomatic solutions. This is
crucial when you are creating embedded domain-specific languages
(eDSL). So it is absolutely necessary knowledge to have in your
pocket.

## Definitions

As a guide through the dark forest of operators and brackets, this
blog post focuses on __operator fixity__ — a Haskell feature
controlling the *associativity* and *precedence* of operators
(explained later). Fixity glues different operators and controls their
behaviour. When used properly, this feature helps to write more
maintainable code and provide more convenient APIs.

Before we proceed further and dive into the main fixity part, let's
walk through the basic definitions we need in order to work with
operators.

Even though operators may seem straightforward, in reality, it's a
convoluted topic that involves multiple different concepts:

* Operator
* Notation
* Arity
* Associativity
* Precedence

To understand how operators are used, we will go through the
definition of each concept with explanation and examples.

### Operator

::: {.definition}

An __operator__ is a function defined using one or more operator symbols.

:::

The below table contains a few standard operators in Haskell:

+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| __Name__ | __Description__                             |
+==========+=============================================+
| `+`      | Numeric addition                            |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `-`      | Numeric subtraction                         |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `*`      | Numeric multiplication                      |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `^`      | Numeric power                               |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `==`     | Equality                                    |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `<=`     | Less or equal                               |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `>`      | Greater                                     |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `&&`     | Boolean "and"                               |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `||`     | Boolean "or"                                |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `.`      | Function composition                        |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `$`      | Function application                        |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `&`      | Function application with flipped arguments |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `>>=`    | Monad bind                                  |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `<$>`    | Functor mapping                             |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| `<*>`    | Applicative chaining                        |
+----------+---------------------------------------------+

According to the [Haskell 2010 Report][haskell2010], only the
following characters are allowed to be used as operator symbols:

```
! $ % & ⋆ + . / < = > ? @ \ ^ | - ~ : #
```

However, not all variants of these symbols are possible to use as
operators. The following combinations are already reserved for
built-ins and syntax, so you can't define your custom operators using
the exact names from the list below:

* `..` — list range syntax for enumerations
* `:` — list constructor (operator for prepending elements to lists)
* `::` — type signature
* `=` — defining functions, data types and variables
* `\` — escaping characters and multiline strings gaps
* `|` — alternatives: guards and constructors in sum types
* `<-` and `->` — function arrows, binding variables, and much more;
  check our separate blog post to explore the entire
  [Arrows Zoo](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/arrows-zoo)
* `@` — as-patterns and visible
  [type applications](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/type_applications.html)
* `~` — irrefutable patterns
* `=>` — contexts (aka constraints) in functions and instances

### Arity

::: {.definition}
Functions and operators (being functions themselves) have the notion
of __arity__ — the number of input arguments that function takes.
:::

All functions can have zero to many input elements and only one
output. So, if we have `+` that takes two numbers and returns the
result of their addition, then we can say that the arity of `+` is
equal to two.

The following terms represent the most common arities:

* __Nullary__ — zero arguments
* __Unary__ — single argument
* __Binary__ — two arguments
* __Ternary__ — three arguments

This guide focuses on __binary__ operators as they are the most common
in the ecosystem. However, keep in mind that operators of other
arities can perfectly exist as well.

#### Nullary operators*

You can go one step further with improving your eDSLs in Haskell and
define a *nullary* operator (an operator that takes no
arguments). This feature doesn't require any language extensions.

For example, we use it in [Stan](@github(kowainik)) to define more
readable AST patterns that match specific Haskell code :

```haskell
(?) :: PatternAst
(?) = PatternAstAnything
```

Note that when using the nullary operator, you need to put it in parentheses:

```haskell
opApp (httpLit ||| urlName) addPathOp (?)
|||
opApp (?) addPathOp urlName
```

### Notation

::: {.definition}
Depending on where operators appear in relation to their arguments,
their position can be described using one of the following two forms:

* __infix__ — operator comes between its arguments
* __prefix__ — operator comes before its arguments
:::

By default, operators are used in the _infix_ form. Here is an example
of multiplying two numbers using a _binary_ operator `*`:

```haskell
24 * 16
```

You can see that this is indeed the _infix_ form, as `*` itself is
positioned between two input numbers.

Every operator could additionally be transformed into _prefix_
form. To use an operator in the _prefix_ form, put it in `()` and move
its position to the first place (like for ordinary functions):

```haskell
(*) 24 16
```

Unlike operators, ordinary functions by default are used in the
*prefix* form. For instance, below is an example of a *binary*
function `elem`, used in its *prefix* form and supplied with two
arguments:

```haskell
elem 5 myList
```

However, you can use a function in the *infix* form as well! For that,
you need to put it in backticks (`\``) and change its position:

```haskell
5 `elem` myList
```

In sum, you actually have four ways to use one function/operator (as they often come together).

```haskell
plus 3 4     -- function in prefix form (default)
3 `plus` 4   -- function in infix form
3 + 4        -- operator in infix form (default)
(+) 3 4      -- operator in prefix form
```

The most interesting notation that we are going to focus on is the
__infix__ form of operators and functions. The compiler treats them
differently from prefix ones, and they also come with a special
mechanism controlling their behaviour which we look into in further
steps.

#### Postfix operators*

::: {.definition}
Haskell allows defining __postfix__ operators — operators that are
positioned *after* their arguments. Such operators must be *unary*
(take precisely one argument).
:::

To use this feature, you need to enable the [PostfixOperators][postfix]
language extension. However, you need to put your operator application
(operator together with its argument) in parentheses.

The most popular example of using this feature is writing a fancy factorial:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE PostfixOperators #-}

(!) :: Integer -> Integer
(!) n = product [1..n]
```

```haskell
ghci> (10!)
3628800
```

Another example of using postfix operators is the improvement of the
eDSL for the Haskell CSS library [clay](@hackage) by allowing to write size in
percentages:

```haskell
(%) :: Rational -> Size Percentage
(%) = fromRational

css :: Css
css = do
    footer <> header ? do
        width (100%)
        maxWidth (100%)
        backgroundColor lightGrey

    footer ? marginTop (2%)

```

### Associativity

::: {.definition}
__Associativity__ is a property of an operator describing how multiple
usages of the same operator are grouped in the absence of
parentheses. In other words, associativity describes how brackets are
placed when you don't write them explicitly. This property applies to
binary operators.
:::

Let's look at an example to understand better what associativity
means. If you have a binary operator ◯ and you write the following
expression:

a ◯ b ◯ c ◯ d

There are several ways how `()` can be placed:

1. ((a ◯ b) ◯ c) ◯ d
2. a ◯ (b ◯ (c ◯ d))
3. (a ◯ b) ◯ (c ◯ d)
4. a ◯ ((b ◯ c) ◯ d)
5. (a ◯ (b ◯ c)) ◯ d

::: {.definition}
Depending on the resulting order of parentheses, if you don't write
them explicitly, we can define the associativity type of an operator:

* If `()` are placed like in option 1, the operator is called
  __left-associative__ (the brackets are accumulated on the left).
* If `()` are placed like in option 2, the operator is called
  __right-associative__ (the brackets are accumulated on the right).
:::

Other ways of placing `()` – options 3-5 – don't have names, and
usually brackets are not placed in such ways automatically. Such
combinations can be achieved only through manual placement.

<hr>

::: {.definition}
If for any values `a`, `b` and `c`, the result of evaluating
expression after specifying `()` either in option 1 or option 2 is the
same, the operation that the operator performs is called
__associative__.
:::

The exact definition explained with a formula:

a ◯ b ◯ c ≡ a ◯ (b ◯ c) ≡ (a ◯ b) ◯ c

Some common examples of associative operators include addition,
multiplication, list appending, function composition, function
application, boolean "and", boolean "or".

On the other hand, operators such as subtraction, division, equality,
comparison don't satisfy this property.

The consequence of the operator being associative is that it doesn't
matter how you place `()`; the result will always be the same. So, if
placing parentheses can affect the performance, you can set them
differently and still get the same result but faster.

<hr>

::: {.definition}
Operators also can be __non-associative__ (not-right and not-left
associative).

This means that the expression "a ◯ b ◯ c" doesn't make
sense, no matter how you place `()`.
:::

For example, the operator of the integer comparison can't be used several times:

```haskell
-- ❌ incorrect
1 <= x <= 10
```

Indeed, it would be nice to be able to write the code above to
describe concise range checks. However, it's not possible, and you
need to write it like this:

```haskell
-- ✅ correct
1 <= x && x <= 10
```

One way to understand the reason for this is to look at types:

```haskell
(<=) :: Int -> Int -> Bool
```

You can see that a specialised version of the `<=` operator takes two
`Int`s and returns a `Bool`, so it can't be chained because the return
type can't be matched with the input type. However, this is not
universally true for all operators with different input and output
types. Polymorphic operators still can have associativity and be
chained.

### Precedence

While associativity is a handy property when dealing with the series
of one operator usages, it wouldn't answer the question "which
operator to apply first if I deal with several in a single
expression?" It makes the following known "puzzle" so tricky without
diligent thinking:

2 + 2 * 4

::: {.small-img}
![2+2*4](/images/posts/fixity/224.png)
:::

Therefore, it's not enough to know their associativity to figure out
how `()` will be placed when using different operators. You also need
to have information about their *precedence*.

::: {.definition}
Operator __precedence__ describes the priority of operators and their relation to each other.
:::

For example, we know that `*` has *higher precedence* than `+` from
school math classes. Thus, when we write 2 + 3 * 4, we understand this
expression as 2 + (3 * 4) and not (2 + 3) * 4. Therefore, we conclude
that `*` has higher priority over `+`.

But what happens if you use school operators in a programming
language? The compiler didn't go to school; hence it doesn't know
about these conventions. And that's why it needs some ground rules
about their priorities.

Even if you embed rules for several common operators directly in the
compiler, you won't get the same level of control for custom operators
from some external libraries. How will the compiler know a proper way
to place the brackets? It won't. No standard rules are telling how the
compiler should behave based exclusively on operator names. The
priority information is specific to each use case and needs to be
learned.

::: {.exercise}

For the sake of a small challenge, you can try to guess the inferred
placement of parentheses for the following use case:

```haskell
abs n `mod` 100 `div` 10
```

<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#solution2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="solution2">
    Show solution
</button>
:::: {#solution2 .solution .collapse}

Answer

```haskell
((abs n) `mod` 100) `div` 10
```
::::
:::

<hr>

If you want to check the placement of brackets in a Haskell expression quickly, you can use the following TemplateHaskell trick in GHCi by putting your expression inside `$([| |])`.

```haskell
$ ghci -ddump-splices -XTemplateHaskell
ghci> $([| readMaybe <$> getLine >>= print |])
<interactive>:1:3-39: Splicing expression
    [| readMaybe <$> getLine >>= print |]
  ======>
    ((readMaybe <$> getLine) >>= print)

```

> 👩‍🔬 In the above code, we use the quotation brackets `[| ... |]` to
> parse an expression into Haskell AST using the GHC parser. Then we
> convert it back to Haskell using the Template Haskell splice
> `$(...)`. This invokes the TemplateHaskell pretty-printer that
> inserts all implicit parentheses for us.

The key part of the above output is the last line:
`((readMaybe <$> getLine) >>= print)`. Here we can see how the
compiler consumes this expression and puts the brackets for us. From
this example, we can say that `<$>` operation will be applied first,
and only then the bind operator `>>=` will use the result. That means
that `<$>` has higher priority than `>>=`.

<hr>

As we finished with all the necessary terms and concepts, let's move
to the following section, where we are going to learn how to use (and
specify) all this information for your own operators.

## Fixity declaration

Previously we saw that the compiler uses information about operators
associativity and precedence to parse expressions correctly. However,
this algorithm is not magical, and information about standard
operators is not hard-coded in the compiler internals.

In Haskell, __all__ operations have this information without any
exceptions. To manually specify operator associativity and precedence,
you can use syntax called __fixity declaration__.

And, consequently, all standard operators have fixity declarations
too. In fact, the Haskell 2010 Report specifies associativity and
precedence for operators from the standard library `base`.

In order to define the fixity for your operator, you need to write a
special declaration in the same module as your defined function. The
general shape of a fixity declaration is the following:

```
infix[l|r] NUMBER <Comma-separated operators>

```

Explanation of the above syntax:

* The first keyword defines associativity:
    - __infix__ — non-associative
    - __infixr__ — right-associative
    - __infixl__ — left-associative
* The __NUMBER__ defines operator precedence. It must be in the range
  between 0 and 9 inclusive. The higher number implies higher
  precedence.
* Then, you enumerate a __comma-separated list of operators__ that
  would have declared associativity and precedence.

> ⚠️ If you don't specify fixity for an operator, it will use the
> default, which is `infixl 9`

> ℹ️ There was a GHC proposal to allow a more flexible scheme for the
> operator precedence, but the proposal was closed.
>
> * [GHC proposal: Use nontotal precedence for operators](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/165)

The below image summarises the relation between Haskell syntax and
operator associativity:


![Fixity](/images/posts/fixity/fixity.png)

### Fun part*

The following real-life analogies of operator associativity can help
with remembering the rules around placing brackets:

* When a dog eats food, it eats immediately everything that is given
  to it. So a dog eating food is __infixl__.

![Dog eats](/images/posts/fixity/dog-eats2.gif)

* When you try to feed a cat, it first needs to sniff (evaluate) all
  provided food and only then it can start eating it. So a cat eating
  food is __infixr__.

![Cat vs Dog](/images/posts/fixity/cat-vs-dog.gif)

* When you pet a parrot, it bytes the first piece but most of the food
  goes past it right on the floor. That's why a parrot eating food is
  __infix__.

![Parrot eats](/images/posts/fixity/parrot-eats.gif)

The following type signatures demonstrate the above analogies:

```haskell
🥣 :: 🐕 -> 🥩 -> 🐕
🍽 :: 🐠 -> 🐈 -> 🐈
🎯 :: 🦜 -> 🌽 -> 🐥
```

Applying the same operator multiple times helps to recall its associativity:

```haskell
🥣(🥣(🥣🐕🥩)🥩)🥩
🍽🐠(🍽🐠(🍽🐠🐈))
🎯🦜🌽
```

For better performance, *infixl* operators should be __eager__ (just
like dogs). And *infixr* operators in Haskell are usually __lazy__
(similar to cats). And, of course, infix operators are __wild__.

### Standard examples

Now, let's see a few examples from the standard library. Here are a
few common operators as they are defined in `base`:

```haskell
-- operator fixities for comparison operators
infix  4  ==, /=, <, <=, >=, >

-- | Boolean "and" operator.
infixr 3  &&
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool

-- | Boolean "or" operator.
infixr 2  ||
(||) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool

infixl 4 <$>
(<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
(<$>) = fmap
```

The above examples are suggesting us that the following information is
held:

* Comparison operators (e.g. `==`, `<`) are *non-associative*.
* Boolean "and" (`&&`) and "or" (`||`) operators are
  *right-associative*, so the expression `x && y && z` parses as
  `x && (y && z)`. This is important because those operators are lazy in
  their second (right) argument.
* Operator `&&` has *higher precedence* than `||`, so the expression
  `x && y || z` parses as `(x && y) || z`.
* Comparison operators have *higher precedence* than boolean
  operators, so you don't need to use `()` around comparisons when
  performing multiple checks:
    - `isBetween (a, b) x = a <= x && x <= b`
    - `outOfBounds (a, b) x = a <= b && (x < a || b < x)`
* The functor operator `<$>` is *left-associative*, meaning that
  `f <$> g <$> x` parses as `(f <$> g) <$> x`, but it still works anyway
  because the `Functor` instance for a function is a function
  composition. So the previous expression is equal to `f . g <$> x`
  but you may see slightly worse error messages in case of errors when
  using multiple functor operators instead of the composition.

::: {.exercise}

__Exercise__

To strengthen your understanding of operators associativity and
precedence, try to solve the following exercise.

We have a  __"logic implication"__ operator defined as follows:

```haskell
infixr 1 ==>
(==>) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
a ==> b = not a || b
```

Can you guess how the compiler will place parentheses in the following
cases and what results those expressions will produce? Take into
consideration the given knowledge of fixity.

```haskell
ghci> False ==> False ==> False

ghci> False ==> (False ==> False)

ghci> (False ==> False) ==> False

ghci> True || True  ==> False

ghci> (True || True)  ==> False

ghci> True || (True ==> False)

```


<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#solution1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="solution1">
    Show solution
</button>
:::: {#solution1 .solution .collapse}

```haskell
ghci> False ==> False ==> False
True
ghci> False ==> (False ==> False)
True
ghci> (False ==> False) ==> False
False
ghci> True || True  ==> False
False
ghci> (True || True)  ==> False
False
ghci> True || (True ==> False)
True
```

### Discovering fixity

Though fixity is critical information for writing correct and
performant code, fixity is only visible on the declaration level, but
not during the usage. However, there are ways to find it out for
yourself.

You can get the information about the fixity using the `:i` command in
GHCi. The command gives not only the type signature, module it is
coming from but also data about fixity.

```haskell
ghci> :i (&&)
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool 	-- Defined in 'GHC.Classes'
infixr 3 &&
```

Another way to discover fixity is to check the documentation. Haddock
renders fixity information near the type signature, so you can also
see it when browsing through the docs:

![Haddock: Boolean operators](/images/posts/fixity/bool-operators.png)

<hr class="fish">

> ⚠️ Currently, you will see the fixity information only if the
> operator has an __explicit__ fixity declaration. If the *implicit*
> default one is used (`infixl 9`), neither Haddock nor GHCi displays
> it.

### Functions fixity

We've mentioned before that you can turn ordinary functions into
operators by using backticks. In that case, the entire
operator-specific behaviour applies to them as well, including the
ability to specify precedence and associativity via the fixity
declaration.

You can write explicit fixity declarations for infix forms of ordinary
functions, as shown in the example below. Otherwise, the default
fixity `infixl 9` will be applied to infix calls of normal functions.

```haskell
-- | Integer division.
infixl 7 `div`
div :: Integral a => a -> a -> a

-- | Integer modulus.
infixl 7 `mod`
mod :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
```

### Dots on i

The Haskell standard library contains very diverse operators of all
forms, shapes and fixities. Let's look at a few interesting cases of
fixity declarations that are extremely useful to know in order to
understand how functions work together in the language.

Composition and application are essential parts of Haskell. They are
also operators, so let's look at how they are defined:

```haskell
-- | Function composition.
infixr 9  .
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)

-- | Function application.
infixr 0  $
($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
```

The function composition operator has the highest precedence – 9,
while the function application operator has the lowest 0.

In other words, function composition will group arguments first, while
function application will be applied last. Usually `$` is used to
avoid redundant `()`. Compare:

```haskell
foo list = length (filter odd (map (div 2) (filter even (map (div 7) list))))
foo list = length $ filter odd $ map (div 2) $ filter even $ map (div 7) list
```

And similarly, it's common to define functions in Haskell in
point-free style using function composition. So the above example can
be rewritten using the dot operator:

```haskell
foo = length . filter odd . map (div 2) . filter even . map (div 7)
```

Implicit parentheses in the example above resemble the original version:

```haskell
length . (filter odd . (map (div 2) . (filter even . map (div 7))))
```

### Beyond fixity rules

Even if the lowest precedence that you can give to an operator is 0
and the highest is 9, there are a few special cases where things in
Haskell go beyond these rules.

For example, consider the following definition, including function composition:

```haskell
hasWithLen :: Int -> [[Int]] -> [[Int]]
hasWithLen n = elem n . map (\l -> length l : l)
```

If you place `()` explicitly in the function definition, you will get
the following expression:

```haskell
(elem n) . (map (\l -> (length l) : l))
```

From this, you can see function application (space) has even higher
precedence than function composition (`.`).  In some sense, you can
think of a space (function application in `f x y`) as a built-in
operator with the highest precedence 10.

<hr>

Let's look at another peculiar situation. Even though the [Haskell
2010 Report][haskell2010] doesn't specify the fixity for the function
arrow, from the code and the GHCi `:i` command, we observe that the
fundamental built-in function arrow has precedence `-1`:

```haskell
infixr -1 ->
data (->) a b
```

Since the arrow is *right-associative* (as the fixity declaration
tells us), we now understand how parentheses are placed in all type
signatures and why we can skip them (as we always do) in there.

```haskell
Int -> (Int -> Bool)  -- same as Int -> Int -> Bool
```

Another way of looking at this is the following: all functions in
Haskell take exactly one argument and return exactly one result. Both
the argument and result can be a function. Haskell just provides lots
of syntax sugar to make this behaviour invisible on the surface.

### Common errors

Using operators can lead to confusing compiler errors in multiple
cases due to the fixity conflicts and other tricky moments.

For instance, if you try to use two different operators with the same
precedence but different associativity, GHC outputs an error:

```haskell
ghci> Just 5 == subtract 3 <$> Just 8

<interactive>:7:1: error:
    Precedence parsing error
        cannot mix '==' [infix 4] and '<$>' [infixl 4] in the same infix expression
```

Or, if you use operator section, applied to the expression that
involves multiple operators:

```haskell
    The operator '<>' [infixr 6] of a section
        must have lower precedence than that of the operand,
          namely '$' [infixr 0]
        in the section: '<> HashSet1.fromList $ x :| xs'

    |
313 |             x:xs -> (<> HashSet1.fromList $ x :| xs)
    |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

<hr>

Let's look at another type of errors happening due to the usage of
operators. If you want to print a string literal, the simple code
works:

```haskell
putStrLn "The number is 42"
```

But now you want to print a variable instead of a fixed number, and if
you do a straightforward change like below, you will see an error
message:

```haskell
putStrLn "The number is: " ++ show n

    • Couldn't match expected type '[Char]' with actual type 'IO ()'
    • In the first argument of '(++)', namely
        'putStrLn "The number is: "'
      In the expression: putStrLn "The number is: " ++ show n
      In an equation for 'it': it = putStrLn "The number is: " ++ show
```

The error message tells us that there is a type error, so you might
think you've probably used a wrong function (either converting to
string or appending strings). However, the error, in fact, is due to
the precedence of operators. The above expression is parsed by the
compiler as follows:

```haskell
(putStrLn "The number is: ") ++ (show n)
```

So you're trying to append the string with the result of printing the
string, not with the already written text literal. Now you see that
the compiler complains rightfully.

This error can be easily fixed by either using explicit parentheses or
using the dollar operator `$` (remember its precedence?):

```haskell
putStrLn ("The number is: " ++ show n)
putStrLn $ "The number is: " ++ show n
```

### Type-level operators

So far, we've been discussing only term-level custom
operators. However, in Haskell, you also can have __type-level
operators__ — types or type-level functions defined using operator
symbols. And you can write fixity declarations for them exactly in the
same way as for ordinary operators.

Interesting fact: the previous trick with the function arrow's
precedence allows you to define the type-level function application
operator similar to the term-level one, and it will work as expected:

```haskell
infixr 0 $
type family ($) (f :: a -> b) (x :: a) :: b where
    f $ x = f x

foo :: Int -> IO $ Maybe $ Either Int String
```

We can verify the placement of parentheses in GHCi:

```haskell
ghci> :t foo
foo :: Int -> IO (Maybe (Either Int String))

```

Check out the [type-operators](@hk) package for more examples.

### Local fixity declarations

Usually, operators are defined *globally* on the module's top-level
(together with their fixity declarations). However, you can also
introduce *local* variables or even function arguments as
operators. And this raises a relevant question: can you define
fixities for local operators? The answer is "Yes".

Haskell allows __local fixity declarations__ — fixity declarations for
local variables in `let` or `where`. Below is a small example
demonstrating this feature:

```haskell
modSum :: Int -> Int -> Int
modSum x y = x % y + y % x
  where
    infix 7
    (%) :: Int -> Int -> Int
    (%) = mod
```

In the code above, we define a local operator `%` as `mod` (similar to
other programming languages), specify a fixity declaration in the same
`where` block, and use it within the function. By providing fixity
greater than for the `+` operator (which is 6), we can omit
parentheses and get the correct results as desired.

Similarly, you can define an operator with its fixity declaration
using `let-in` syntax:

```haskell
operators :: Int -> Int -> Int
operators x y =
    let infixl 8 ^-^
        (^-^) :: Int -> Int -> Int
        a ^-^ b = a ^ 2 - b ^ 2
    in x ^-^ y * y ^-^ x

```

Moreover, you can even name function arguments as operators during the
function declaration. Here is an example of the standard function `on`
that uses this feature:

```haskell
infixl 0 `on`
on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
(.*.) `on` f = \x y -> f x .*. f y
```

The function `on` is defined in infix form using backticks (and it has
an associated fixity declaration). It defines its first argument (a
binary function) as a variable with the operator name `.*.`. And then,
it uses this operator in the body as an ordinary binary operator.

> ⚠️ Though, unlike locally defined operators (with `let-in` and
> `where`), you can't assign fixities to operator arguments using
> local fixity declarations.

## Takeaways

After reading this blog post, you are equipped with the main
terminology and functionality around operator usages. Let's quickly
recap the most important highlights:

* __Always specify fixities for your operators.__ Otherwise, the
  default fixity will be assigned. Better to explicitly say what you
  want instead of keeping additional overhead about default behaviour
  in your (and users) mind. Remember also that fixity info is not
  rendered on Hackage, and even GHCi doesn't display this information
  with the `:info` command when not specified.
* __Put operator fixity before the type signature and after Haddock
  documentation.__ Our [style guide](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide)
  suggests this style. By following it, you will see all the
  information about the operator in one place.
* __Specify associativity even for associative operators.__ Even if
  the operation performed by the operator doesn't care about the order
  of parentheses, you still need to place `()` somehow for the
  operator. Hence, the compiler knows how to evaluate the
  expression. For instance, the order of `()` can affect performance
  in some cases (e.g. for the `++` list appending operator), so keep
  this in mind when deciding. Usually, functions and operators in
  Haskell are lazy in their second (right) argument, so `infixr` is a
  good default if the operator can be chained. Otherwise, you can use
  `infix`. But it's always better to consult the implementation first
  and think about potential use-cases before writing the fixity
  declaration.
* __Always use `()` when different operators are involved.__ You may
  see how everything works in trivial cases without explicit
  brackets. But when expressions become more involved, it may be hard
  to do so. Additionally, implicit parentheses can unexpectedly result
  in wrong or misleading outputs. Also, since fixities are
  user-defined, they may change between versions and lead to
  unpredictable results. If you'd like to enforce that rule, you can
  even mark your operator as `infix` even if it can be associative to
  force users always to put `()` explicitly.
* __Provide a non-operator version to operators.__ Using operators can
  lead to elegant and fancy-looking code, but it's not necessarily
  easily maintainable. It is always a good idea to give people a
  choice of not using operators and rely on more descriptive
  functions.
* __Provide non-unicode versions for Unicode operators.__ In Haskell,
  you can define operators using unicode symbols after enabling the
  [UnicodeSyntax][unicode-syntax] extension. But it can be challenging
  to work with such operators in various scenarios. So don't sacrifice
  comfortability in favour of fancy-looking code and definitely
  provide alternatives.
* __Use Stan to detect missing fixity declarations.__ Haskell static
  analyser [Stan](@github(kowainik)) produces a warning when the
  [operator misses fixity declaration](https://github.com/kowainik/stan/wiki/All-Inspections#stan-0301).

<hr>

Careless abuse of operators can lead to less readable code. But
knowing operators up and down can help you write code that is both
maintainable and elegant. And you can easily say that you've mastered
operators after reading this comprehensive guide. If you ask us about
the one message you can take away from this guide, it would be this:

*When defining a lot of custom operators, it makes sense to fixate on
fixities*. 😉
