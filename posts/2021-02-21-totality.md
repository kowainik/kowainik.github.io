Along with the popular Functional Programming (FP) concepts such as purity or
immutability, there is a significant one, which couldn't boast much discussion
around it — __totality__. Totality is an exceptionally interesting notion in the
FP context. And you probably already use it and are aware of some pitfalls of
not having totality in your code, but maybe the terminology doesn't ring a bell.

In this blog post, we want to provide a comprehensive guide to the concept of
totality in Functional Programming by demystifying its meaning, giving a lot of
examples, and recommending how to get tools to help you write maintainable,
testable code. You will find this blog post helpful if you are interested in
understanding the fundamentals of FP.

> Note: we will use Haskell to demonstrate and explain the totality, but the

## Definition

__Functions__ are core elements of Functional Programming. Functions are
expressions that have a type that could be primitive or more complex. We can say
that each function has an input, 0 or more arguments of some type and only one
output, returning type. In other words, a function transforms its inputs to the
output, and the function definition describes what actual work a function does
to produce its result.

A function is __total__ if it is defined for all inputs of its corresponding
type, or in other words, if a function returns the output on any possible values
of the input types.

For example, the following function that checks if the given integer is zero is
total:

```haskell
isZero :: Integer -> Bool
isZero n = n == 0
```

The above function is defined for any value of type `Integer`. No matter what it
would receive as the argument, it will always return the answer – `True` or
`False`.

On the other hand, a function like "integral division" is __partial__
(non-total). Though the division works perfectly on most of the inputs, the
result of division by zero is not defined; therefore, there is an argument on
which the function can't return a reasonable result (and that's why you may find
the `isZero` function helpful). Partial functions are not defined on all their
inputs and usually blow up when given something they cannot handle.

### Is that math?

![FP vs Math](/images/totality/fp-vs-math.png)

The definition of totality originated in math. It has a similar formulation to
what we provided above and could be understood in the same way.

Total function is a function defined for all elements in its domain. The domain
is the set of x-values that can be put into a function. In other words, it’s the
set of all possible values of the independent variable.

We can notice that the math function domain is the same as the input of our functions.

The following image is the canonical way to represent math functions, mapping
values from domain A to values of range B. If it were a programming function, we
would say that it maps type A to type B. Both total and partial way could be
illustrated in that manner:

![Totality in math](/images/totality/totality-math.png)

However, despite all similarities, functions in programming are a bit different
because they have a notion of *computation*.

Math doesn't consider how long it takes for a function to calculate or how much
memory it needs. Moreover, functions in programming can hang, and it is vital to
keep this in mind when you write code.

Functions in math also don't have side-effects, e.g. reading from file. But all
these concerns are valid in the context of programming.

To summarise, here is a short list of possible things that functions in
programming can do, and math functions cannot:

 * Hang (loop indefinitely or takes unreasonable time to compute)
 * Throw exceptions
 * Terminate before producing a result in case of insufficient memory
 * Have side-effects (read from files, send requests to web services, etc.)

Functional Programming is closer to the original math definition in the sense
that its functions are pure -- they have no side-effects. This essential FP
paradigm allows us to talk about the concept of totality in a programming
context, even though programming functions are very different from math
functions.

### Termination*

*advanced section, could be skipped*

As we look at totality from the programming point of view, we need to describe a
very close concept to totality — __termination__. Termination gives the
guarantee that function does produce a result in a finite amount of time.
Usually, when people talk about __total functional programming__, they mean
programming with *total* functions that *terminate successfully*.

<hr>

This concept of termination is more relevant to advanced languages called
*proof-assistants* used to write proofs as programming functions. In such
languages, successful proof must be a total and terminating function.
Proof-assistants are invaluable in the software verification areas.

However, in real-life software, not all functions must be total. For instance, a
Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) or a Web Backend are not supposed to terminate
eventually on their own. They should run infinitely and respond to requests in a
timely manner.

<hr>

The terminology of totality is a bit ambiguous in programming due to the
different use-cases. In some places, total functions are required to terminate,
while others require only to handle all inputs' values. We will try to cover the
most common definition of totality in this post.

Note as well that totality is not a straightforward and universally-applicable
idea. We will make a few common simplifications in this post regarding totality
in modern languages. But bear in mind that there are a lot of specifics that
need to be kept in view. There are different methods of making functions total
and guaranteeing this property for compiled vs interpreted, for typed vs untyped
languages.

<hr>

Another aspect — __laziness__; it also affects the work of pure functions in
different ways. Infinite functions could be total (with termination notion) due
to laziness. For instance, the following recursive function produces an infinite
list. And if you'll try to print the resulting list to the terminal, you will
wait indefinitely for this function to finish:

```haskell
multipliedByTwo :: Int -> [Int]
multipliedByTwo x = x : multipliedByTwo (x * 2)
```

However, due to laziness, you still can take the first five elements of the list
and get the result:

```haskell
ghci> take 5 (multipliedByTwo 3)
[3, 6, 12, 24, 48]
```

<hr>

If being absolutely honest, Haskell is not a total functional programming
language by default. It has a special value called *"bottom"* (⊥) that can be
passed to any pure function. When such a value is being evaluated, it throws a
runtime error. You can use standard Haskell functions `undefined` or `error` at
the bottom. It means that even the pure and total function `isZero` we defined
above could fail in runtime if used on bottom elements:

```haskell
ghci> isZero undefined
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:79:14 in base:GHC.Err
  undefined, called at <interactive>:2:8 in interactive:Ghci1

ghci> isZero (error "I'm a banana, I do what I wanna")
*** Exception: I'm a banana, I do what I wanna
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at <interactive>:3:9 in interactive:Ghci1
```

To design a complete total system, we need to have the input set without bottom
(⊥) elements. An example of pure total language is
[Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/) — a configuration language where all functions
must be pure, total and terminating.

If interested, you can read more about research in total functional programming (see in [Links](#links)).

## Not totally total

![Fight](/images/totality/Fight.gif)

Usually, in FP, you don't use the phrase "total function" as, by default,
functions are considered to be total. However, this can't be the case all the
time; it would be too easy. There is an opposite concept of *totality* –
__partiality__, which means that a function is __not__ defined for all inputs of
its type.

Here are a few examples of common partial functions:

 * __Taking a list element by index.__ The index can be negative or be outside
   the list bounds, so it's impossible to get the element in such cases.
 * __Parsing string to an integer.__ Not every string represents a valid numeric
   number, so a parsing function fails in such cases.
 * __Printf-like pretty-printing.__ If you specify the formatting with a
   separate string, it may fail at runtime on a wrong number of arguments or
   when types of arguments don't match.
 * __Mathematical functions__: division by zero, square root of a negative
   number, etc.
 * __Multiplication of matrices.__ If the dimensions of the two matrices are not
   aligned, it is impossible to multiply one matrix with another.
 * Laziness brings more interesting partiality cases to the table. When you can
   have infinite lists, functions like `sum`, `sort` or `reverse` become partial
   because they hang on infinite lists.


## Why should we care?

As a developer, you have to deal with runtime exceptions all the time.
Programming with total functions helps to avoid some of the runtime exceptions
by ultimately preventing them from happening in the first place. But, at the
same time, it requires time and discipline to write total functions. So you may
think that writing total functions is a big price to pay for reducing the number
of runtime exceptions since total functions won't remove all exceptions
entirely. But we believe that you actually should care about totality due to the
few other perks as well:

 * Even when writing a huge number of unit tests, you still can miss some cases.
   Total functional programming gives more guarantees about code correctness.
 * Debugging runtime exceptions can be tedious for developers. But users of
   buggy products are frustrated even more. Spending more time on making
   functions total pays off in the long run.
 * Total functional programming results in more maintainable, modular and
   composable programming. The composition of total functions is total. It means
   that you can refactor your code painlessly, split it into smaller and
   reusable parts, combine different components, and still be confident that it
   works. While working with partial functions, you may introduce new fragile
   logic not covered by tests, forget to update tests and experience unpleasant
   production failures.
 * It is much easier to reason about total functions. You don't need to keep
   track of all input states, whether they are valid and whether functions throw
   exceptions. Therefore, you can understand the existing code faster (and
   become more productive quicker as a consequence). Not to mention that code
   reviews will be more helpful and easier for everyone when you write and
   review total functions.


![Totality](/images/totality/totality.png)

## Partially correct

We've already seen some examples of non-total functions above. But now, let's
take a closer look and focus more on recognising partiality and discussing
different situations where it is possible to (unintentionally) introduce
partiality. We will talk mostly about pure functions (except one example with
`IO` for the sake of understandability) because this case is more interesting.
Impure functions can easily be non-total due to exceptions.

Few examples of the most dangerous places where to watch out for partiality:

__Embedded pattern matching in function__

Missing cases (non-empty list in this situation):

```haskell
isEmpty :: [a] -> Bool
isEmpty [] = True
```

__Case-of expression (similar to embedded pattern-matching)__

Missing cases (the `GT` constructor of the `Ordering` type):

```haskell
orderingToInt :: Ordering -> Int
orderingToInt ordering = case ordering of
    LT -> -1
    EQ -> 0
```

![Finish Pattern Matching](/images/totality/finish-pattern-matching.gif)

__Guards__

Uncovered conditions unders the guards:

```haskell
orderingNumber :: Ord a => a -> a -> Int
orderingNumber x y
    | x < y = -1
    | x == y = 0
    | x > y = 1
```

In this case, if using this function on `Double`s, we can get to the point where
none of the conditions will apply (e.g. with `NaN`). In this case, it is good to
have a terminal check.

__Pattern-matching in lambdas__

Though this is very handy to write functions quickly, it is not an easy to write
all-encompassing pattern matching with lambda:

```haskell
takeHeads :: [[a]] -> [a]
takeHeads = map (\(x : _) -> x)
```

Usually, lambdas are used with the (named) wildcard patterns instead.

__Pattern-matching in `let-in`__

Similar to the case with lambdas pattern matching, you can bump into a similar
behaviour:

```haskell
let Just myVal = Map.lookup myKey myMap
```

__Pattern-matching in `where`__

```haskell
patchParagraph :: [Text] -> [Text]
patchParagraph paragraph = ...
  where
    title : _ = paragraph
```

__Pattern-matching in binds: <-__

```haskell
main :: IO
main = do
    [inputFile] <- getArgs
```

> Note: watch out for `MonadFail` instances; sometimes, it can be reasonable to do so.

__Unspecified fields of record data types during initialisation__

```haskell
data User = User
    { userName :: Text
    , userAge :: Int
    }

newUser :: User
newUser = User { userName = "New User" }
```

> Note: this is valid because Haskell is lazy, and all unspecified fields are
> initialised with `error`.

__Records inside sum types__

```haskell
data Address
    = Address { street :: Text, country :: Text }
    | NoAddress
```

When using records inside sum types, you get partial getters (`street` and
`country`) and partial record-update syntax.

__Error__

Using "bottom" function `error`:

```haskell
zipEqual :: [a] -> [a] -> [(a, a)]
zipEqual [] [] = []
zipEqual (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x, y) : zipEqual xs ys
zipEqual _ _ = error "Expecting lists of equal size!"
```

__Undefined__

The special case of `error` without a custom error message:

```haskell
hash256 :: Text -> ByteString
hash256 = undefined
```

__Non-terminating unintentional loops__

```haskell
increment :: Int -> Int
increment x = let x = x + 1 in x
```

![Your RAM is mine](/images/totality/your-ram-is-mine.gif)

__Partial primitive functions__

```haskell
ghci> naturalFromInteger (-3)
*** Exception: arithmetic underflow
```

__Type class instances (non initialised, standard type classes giving errors)__

```haskell
data State = Open | Closed

instance Eq State
```

__Compiler panics__

Sometimes our compilers have bugs or low-level panics in their core functions.
It results in having partial functions in applications.

```haskell
stan: stan: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
  (GHC version 8.8.3 for x86_64-unknown-linux):
    readHieFile: hie file versions don't match for file: .hie/Relude.hie Expected 8083 but got 8082

Please report this as a GHC bug:  https://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug
```

__Segmentation fault__

Even more low-level errors, usually on the level of operating with memory or
Operating System interface manually.

## Fake totality

As in many other areas, people sometimes prefer "fake" safety to no safety at
all. So just as a box-ticking exercise, we plug partiality with seeming safe
case checking. Even if the function becomes total, there could be a few
additional problems with such shaky solutions.

Let's look at a few examples of such tricks.

### Wildcards

Pattern matching, as we've seen, is a frequent candidate for leaking partiality.
And the go-to solution for many cases is to use a wildcard – the pattern that
fits anything. It leads to having a case that will fire up anyway if none of the
above patterns worked.

```haskell
data Status
    = Approved
    | Rejected

run :: Status -> Result
run s = case s of
    Approved -> runApprovedAction
    _ -> runRejectedAction
```

However, it could affect you in the future if you, for example, tweaked the type
a bit to add another status.

```haskell
data Status
    = Approved
    | Rejected
    | Cancelled
```

The problem is that the function still covers all cases of `Status`, but it
doesn't do the right thing on the newly added status. In other words, the
function is total but is still incorrect. In the case of using wildcards, you
should be very careful not to forget any of such places, as even the compiler
won't help you with that, as this is a totally fine function!

To avoid such situations, you can use pattern matching on every pattern without
using wildcards when possible.

### Promises we give

Sometimes we are sure that some event can't possibly happen. And it may be an
absolute truth, but the compiler is not convinced. And rather than trying to be
more accommodating with that, we sometimes catch ourselves writing something
like:

```haskell
error "impossible happened, lol"
error "never ever going to happen, I promise"
```

Then we roll our eyes seeing something like this while running our app:

```haskell
*** Exception: never ever going to happen, I promise
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at <interactive>:3:5
```

The problem with this is that it is not adjustable to logic changes. With such
promises you give, you state a lot of logic in one line. However, not all
entries of usage of your functions could guarantee that they are aware of this
agreement.

### Name convincing

Another technique we tend to use from time to time is safety-by-naming. When you
are sure that the function can accept only a particular input and that no other
input could be provided to the function from anywhere, you can indicate that
using type synonyms (the simple new name for the type).

```haskell
type NonNegative = Int

lastDigit :: NonNegative -> NonNegative
lastDigit n = n `div` 10
```

However, nothing would stop to use the `lastDigit` function with negative
numbers:

```haskell
> lastDigit (-25)
-3
```

The purpose of `NonNegative` type name was in self-documentation. And it works
if this function is internal and guaranteed to be used only in specific places;
however, this is tricky to control in big codebases.

### Trust

Do not trust every pure function from other libraries. Yes, this is correct that
partial functions should be highlighted in the documentation, though, sadly, it
is not always true. And this can come from anywhere! For example, the standard
library in Haskell. People could falsely assume that the most essential and
primary library in the language is trustworthy, but watch out! `base` (name of
the standard library) provides a number of partial functions, so you need to
know about that to be able to get around that.

For example, the `maximum` function from the `base`, that returns the maximum
value from the provided list of elements, fails in the runtime if the list is
empty:

```haskell
maxOfTwo :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int
maxOfTwo list1 list2 = max (maximum list1) (maximum list2)
```

![Maximum Damage](/images/totality/maximum-damage.gif)

The moral of this point is not to question every other thing that is not written
for you. The advice here is to keep an eye on commonly-known precedents and try
to be in the know.

## Totality fighters

Now that we know a few common non-total patterns that can be met in codebases,
let's look at the most popular and effective ways to achieve totality.

![Choose Your Fighter](/images/totality/choose-your-fighter.png)

### General

This section will show some of the common solutions. However, all of the
solutions can bring additional burden to the way you would organise your code
later, so use wisely and consider trade-offs.

#### Returning the default value

In many cases, partiality comes from the impossibility to return anything as a
result. For instance, when you want to get the first element from the list, we
couldn't return anything meaningful when the list is empty. In some of those
cases, we can use some default value established in the right way.

For example, we can extend the partial function to take an argument that we can
use as a result when something went wrong. However, there is a way to do it
without adding any new arguments. The `Monoid` typeclass contains inside the
"default" or "initial" value of the data type with an instance of `Monoid`. It
is called `mempty`. It is useful because it could be used as the returning value
if the result could be found in another way.

#### Returning maybe/either/validation

The previous point methods won't work on some types, where we can not decide on
the "default" element (what is the default for integers? Is it 0 or 1 or -1?).
This is where optional results are useful. Instead of saying that the function
will definitely return you a value, we would say that it will *maybe* return a
value or *maybe* not.

For representing such data, in Haskell, there are several such *optional* sum
types that represent "Or" situation:

* `Maybe a` – represent `Just` a value or `Nothing` at all.
* `Either e a` –  similar to `Maybe` but allows to put more context into the `Nothing` case.
* `Validation e a` – similar to `Either` but allows you to accumulate all kinds
  of failing cases in one go when you want to combine multiple `Validation`s
  later.
* `These a b` –  Allows having one of, two or none results at the same time.

This technique is so popular that some alternative standard libraries in Haskell
have chosen this approach to neutralise partial functions present in the `base`
library.

#### Restrict input types

An alternative to patching output types to represent what the function can
return to us more accurately, we can think of improving the types that our
function can take.

For example, when we want to take the first element of the list, we are pretty
sure that there is at least one element. So why not specify that in the input
itself? We can narrow down what the function can take and have lots of benefits
from this. The `NonEmpty` list data type denotes that the list always has at
least one element.

```haskell
nonEmptyHead :: NonEmpty a -> a
```

#### Separate specialised functions instead of common typeclasses

Another problematic point is when we state that some data types can do more than
they actually can. This could peep out, for example, in some typeclass
instances. When you define an instance of some typeclass, you must implement all
methods of this typeclass. But in some cases, it is not possible.

One example of such a typeclass is `Num` and its instance for the `Natural`
type. `Natural` doesn't have negative numbers, but `Num` contains methods of
negating and subtracting values, leading to partial functions throwing errors in
runtime.

The solution in such cases would be to create smaller abstractions towards
bigger ones that would contain more power. Specifically here, `Num` could be
separated into a few typeclasses: one of them shouldn't have negation, so this
would be convenient to use `Int` and `Nat` together and not worry about getting
a runtime exception depending on the type you use.

On the other hand, if you see that your data type doesn't really fit some of the
existing abstractions, it might be right not to provide an instance of such a
typeclass, even if it leads to a less convenient API.

### Haskell-specific

Haskell provides several tools for reducing partiality in your code. There could
be similar instruments in other functional languages, so we will try to describe
the concept of them applicable to Haskell in this particular case.

#### Compiler

The first and the most important instrument that will help you fight partiality
is the compiler itself. In Haskell it is Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). GHC
provides several warnings and sanity-checks that are particularly useful for
totality checking. For instance, checks on non-exhaustive pattern matching or
uninitialised records.

However, be aware that those warnings are not enabled by default. And we
strongly recommend compiling your Haskell projects with the following flags:

 * `-Wall` — this flag includes multiple useful warnings, and specifically in
   the area of totality, tells GHC to check for non-exhaustive pattern-matching
 * `-Wincomplete-uni-patterns` — enables pattern-matching coverage checker for
   internal variables and lambdas
 * `-Wincomplete-record-updates` — warns when the record-update syntax is used
   with data types that contain records inside sum types.
 * `-Wpartial-fields` — warns when defining a sum type with a partial record
   field inside.

   The easiest way to enable them universally is to add to a
   [common stanza](https://vrom911.github.io/blog/common-stanzas) so that it
   would be applied to all parts of your project at once.

#### Static Analyser

In addition to the compiler effort, you can use static analysers to help you
more with totality. In Haskell, there is the [Stan](@gh:kowainik) analyser; it
warns you on the usage of commonly-known partial functions that fail due to
non-exhaustive pattern-matching or hang when given infinite lists as inputs.
Moreover, it helps with some fake-totality cases, such as usages of undefined or
wildcards in pattern matching on sum types (like in the example from the "Fake
totality" section).

#### Program Verification Tools

As another option of totality/termination guarantees, you can utilise a
verification tool. Haskell has
[LiquidHaskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/) – an
instrument to enforce critical properties at compile time. When using this tool,
you can write additional annotations to your functions in the code specifying
requirements for inputs, and LiquidHaskell will check them if you run it.
LiquidHaskell has a specific goal to eliminate partiality and non-terminating
functions.

> Because Haskell is pure, the only effects it allows are divergence and
> incomplete patterns. If we rule out both these effects, using termination and
> totality checking, the user can rest assured that their functions are total,
> and thus correctly encode mathematical proofs.
> Unfortunately, creative use of certain features of Haskell, in particular data
> types with non-negative recursion and higher-rank types, can be used to write
> non-terminating functions that pass Liquid Haskell’s current checks. Until
> this is fixed, users need to be careful when using such features.

### Future

Languages with __Dependent Types__ (DT), such as
[Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/),
[Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) or
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), can boast having eliminated a whole layer of
partial errors. DT allows you to make your values dependable on other types and
patterns you are working with at the moment and also use them as first-class
objects (pass to functions).

All examples of partial functions we've given before (matrix dimensions, printf,
division by zero, getting element by index) can be converted to total with the
help of DT. You will need to specify your requirements as additional constraints
in type signatures, like on the examples below:

```haskell
div :: (x : Int) -> (y : Int, y /= 0) -> Int

elementAt :: (xs : List a) -> (i : IntNoBiggerThan (length xs)) -> a
```

Would DT solve all of the totality issues? Maybe. But it depends.

We see that most of the dependent type systems were architected with the
totality in mind. See the following quote on the importance of totality:

> Totality is important for dependently typed programs, partly because
> non-terminating proofs are not very useful, and partly for reasons of
> efficiency: if a certain type has at most one total value, then total code of
> that type does not need to be run at all.

## So hard

While reading this blog post, you may think that achieving totality is hard. And
it indeed looks like a lot of things to keep in mind, as well as following some
discipline:

* Use pure functions when possible
* Check for all patterns when performing pattern-matching
* Enable proper compiler warnings
* Use external static analysers or program verifiers

All these steps touch different parts of the workflow and require interacting
with various components. Not everything can be automated. Some steps require
thorough thinking about the architecture (e.g. thinking about modelling your
problem with immutable data and pure functions instead of mutable references and
IO). So automating all of them is not always straightforward. But it pays off
eventually to invest in totality for your code.

It's worth mentioning that even basic totality-checking constructs, such as
patterns coverage checks, are not always easy to implement in tools. For
instance, the following function is total, even though each individual patterns
are not total on their own.

```haskell
ordSub :: Ordering -> Int -> Int -> Int
ordSub ord x y = case ord of
   EQ -> 0
   _ -> case ord of
       GT -> x - y
       LT -> y - x
```

But for a long time, GHC wasn't able to tell that. However, the latest release
of GHC, the 9.0 version, can verify that this function is indeed total.

You can see how totality checking can be challenging to implement even for
fundamental parts of Functional Programming. But it would help every one of us a
lot if more automated totality tools were acceptable to users by default. Until
then, it is a noble and right thing to use what we have now: enable compiler
options, configure and use tools (especially on CI) to detect partiality, and
use established techniques and best-practices in libraries to provide total
code.

## Conclusion

Even being the core concept of Functional Programming, Totality is something
that you need to work on in order to get that. It is not coming for free. You do
not have any guarantees that you won't have runtime exceptions in pure functions
if you write in some particular FP language. There are lots of ways to shoot
yourself in the foot. But it is crucial to understand what totality does, how it
serves us and be able to identify partiality when you see it.

Many of this blog post's illustrations were inspired by the Mortal Kombat game.
Specifically, we used some of the images and gifs from the game, and some of the
elements are adapted to similar situations from the game.
